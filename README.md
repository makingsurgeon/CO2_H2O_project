# CO2_H2O_prediction
This is the repository for the project aiming to improve the prediction of CO2 and H2O concentration in silicate melts. Right now the algorithms are being implemented, and to run the script ```H2O_method.py``` one needs to prepare a csv file in the format of ```Template_Input.csv```.
